# Design Project B COMP4601 2023 Term 2

## Course Summary

COMP4601 is a team-based project development course involving the analysis, design and implementation of embedded, high performance or low power FPGA-based accelerators using high-level synthesis.

Students study concepts through lectures and guided lab exercises during the first half of the course, when project teams are also formed and the project goals are developed. During the second half of the course, students are involved in presenting group seminars and working on their projects. The course finishes with final project presentations.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

- rapidly design and implement digital systems that incorporate programable logic as accelerators,
- explain and put into practice techniques for accelerating computation in hardware,
- independently, and collectively study advanced techniques in digital design and implementation, and
- document and present the work of their team in a professional manner.
